# Cats vs Dogs Classification using CNN

## Project Overview

This project focuses on building a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to classify images of cats and dogs. The model is trained using the Kaggle Dogs vs Cats dataset.

## Problem Statement

The goal of this project is to develop an image classification system that can accurately distinguish between cats and dogs using deep learning techniques.

## Dataset

Dataset used:
https://www.kaggle.com/c/dogs-vs-cats

The dataset contains thousands of labeled images of cats and dogs used for training and evaluation.

## Technologies Used

* Python
* TensorFlow / Keras
* NumPy
* Matplotlib
* Jupyter Notebook

## Model Details

* Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
* Image resizing and normalization
* Training and validation split
* Accuracy and confusion matrix evaluation

## Results

The model achieved good classification accuracy on the validation dataset, showing effective learning of visual features.

## Files Included

* `cats_dogs_cnn.ipynb` – Jupyter Notebook
* `model.h5` – Trained CNN model
* `Project_Report.pdf` – Detailed project report

## How to Run

1. Install required libraries:

```
pip install tensorflow numpy matplotlib
```

2. Open the notebook:

```
jupyter notebook
```

3. Run all cells to train or test the model.

Note: The trained .h5 model file is not uploaded due to GitHub file size limits.
The model can be regenerated by running the notebook.
So, I have uploaded in the project report.
